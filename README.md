👋 Hi there!

##  TEAM PROJECT 404 "Esta no es la página que buscabas...pero sí tu equipo"
Developing a web page according to a design given in Zeplin. Web responsive

## 💻 Technologies
 ``VS Code``
 ``HTML``
 ``SASS``


## 🧐 Requirements

HTML:

* All code is perfectly indented.
* The syntax and semantics are structured from our criteria, in an easy-to-understand way.

CSS / Sass:

* We have divided the Sass into several partials to make it more comfortable and orderly for us, and we have linked them correctly to the main file.
* We have created another separate file for the variables, in which we have added the color palette and the font that is requested to later link them comfortably in each class.
* Most of the web page is laid out with flex and the part of the footer with a CSS grid.
* To make the page more dynamic and interactive, we have added some transitions and animations to the buttons, which are linked to relative and absolute paths.
